# Study Session Behavior

This document describes how study sessions work, including card selection priority, learning card handling, and session completion logic.

## Overview

Study sessions are **offline-first** - all card selection and review logic runs locally using IndexedDB. Reviews sync to the server in the background when online.

## Card Queues

Cards exist in one of four queues:

| Queue | Description | Typical Intervals |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **NEW** | Never seen before | N/A (shown based on daily limit) |
| **LEARNING** | Recently introduced, being drilled | Minutes (1m, 5m, 10m) |
| **REVIEW** | Graduated, spaced repetition | Days to months |
| **RELEARNING** | Forgotten during review, re-drilling | Minutes |

## Card Selection Priority

During a study session, cards are selected in this order:

1. **Learning/Relearning cards due NOW** - These have active timers and take priority. Selected using weighted randomization (more overdue = higher weight).

2. **Mix of New + Review cards** - While learning cards are on cooldown, new and review cards are shown. Selection is proportional to queue sizes (e.g., if 3 new and 7 review cards, ~30% chance of new).

3. **Learning cards on cooldown (due today)** - When no other cards are available AND learning cards exist with cooldowns that haven't expired BUT are due today, show them immediately. This allows completing all study in one sitting.

## Session Completion

A session ends (shows "All Done!" screen) when:

- **All learning cards have graduated** - Their next review is tomorrow or later (moved to REVIEW queue with 1+ day interval)
- **AND no new/review cards remain** - Daily new card limit reached, all review cards done

The session does NOT end when:
- Learning cards are on cooldown but due today - these are shown immediately to continue drilling
- There are still new cards within the daily limit
- There are review cards due today

## Rating Effects

Each rating affects the card differently:

| Rating | Effect on NEW card | Effect on LEARNING card | Effect on REVIEW card |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Again** | → LEARNING (short interval) | Reset to step 1 | → RELEARNING (+1 lapse) |
| **Hard** | → LEARNING (short interval) | Repeat current step | Stay in REVIEW (shorter interval) |
| **Good** | → LEARNING (advances steps) | Advance step (may graduate) | Stay in REVIEW (normal interval) |
| **Easy** | → REVIEW (skips learning) | Graduate immediately | Stay in REVIEW (longer interval) |

## Learning Card Graduation

A learning card **graduates** to the REVIEW queue when:
- Rated **Easy** (immediate graduation)
- Rated **Good** enough times to complete all learning steps

Once graduated, the card's next review is typically 1+ days away, which ends its participation in the current session.

## Daily Limits

- **New cards per day**: Configurable per deck (default: 20)
- **Review cards**: No limit - all due reviews are shown
- **Learning cards**: No limit - always shown when due

When the daily new card limit is reached, the "All Done!" screen offers a **"Study More"** button to add 10 bonus new cards.

## Example Session Flow

```
Start session with:
- 5 new cards (within daily limit)
- 3 review cards due
- 0 learning cards

1. Show mix of new/review cards
   User rates a new card "Good" → goes to LEARNING (due in 10 min)

2. Continue showing new/review cards
   Learning card's 10 min cooldown expires → show it (priority)

3. User rates learning card "Good" → due in 1 day (graduates to REVIEW)

4. Continue until all new/review done, learning cards graduated

5. "All Done!" screen appears
```

## Edge Cases

### All cards are learning cards on cooldown
If the only remaining cards are learning cards with cooldowns (e.g., all due in 5 minutes), they are shown immediately rather than making the user wait. The user can keep drilling until they graduate.

### Single learning card remaining
The same card is shown immediately and repeatedly, even if just rated, until it graduates. No cooldown wait screen — the user prefers to drill continuously in one sitting. Each rating updates the card's state, causing the UI to reset for a fresh review.

### Offline behavior
All session logic works offline. Reviews are stored locally and synced when connectivity returns. The "Ask Claude" feature gracefully fails when offline.
